# Professor Pine Discord Bot Raid Migration Tool

A simple tool to offline-process / migrate Professor Pine raid data to new-format party data (main differences are camel-cased property names instead of snake-case, and an additional property to signify the party as being a raid.)

Eventually the completed parties will be stored in Pine's database, but this migration is necessary to put the completed raids into the correct format for that as well.
